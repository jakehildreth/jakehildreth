- **Does NOT use SemVer** (Semantic Versioning)
- Consistent across all projects (Locksmith, BlueTuxedo, PowerPUG!, Stepper)

### Code Style
- Follow instructions files provided in the project's .github/instructions folder/

### Documentation Standards
- **No emojis** in documentation
- **Clean, concise** documentation style
- **Keep a Changelog** format for CHANGELOG.md
- Focus on practical examples over verbose explanations
- READMEs should focus on: installation, quick start, examples

### PowerShell Specific
- Follows Microsoft PowerShell best practices
- Uses approved verbs (Get-Verb compliance)
- Comment-based help for all functions
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- PowerShell 5.1+ support first, PowerShell Core support next
- Return well-known .NET objects preferred, PSCustomObjects next, Hashtables and other primitives last

### Git Workflow
- Uses conventional commits (e.g., `chore:`, `docs:`, `feat:`, `fix:`)
- Maintains clean history

### Hi. I'm Jake! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently:
  - maintaining:
    - [Locksmith](https://github.com/jakehildreth/Locksmith): A small tool built to find and fix common misconfigurations in Active Directory Certificate Services.
    - [BlueTuxedo](https://github.com/jakehildreth/BlueTuxedo): A tiny tool built to find and fix common misconfigurations in Active Directory-integrated DNS.
    - [PowerPUG!](https://github.com/jakehildreth/PowerPUG): A tiny tool built to help AD Admins tame the Protected Users group.
    - [Stepper](https://github.com/jakehildreth/Stepper): A PowerShell utility module for creating resumable, step-by-step scripts with automatic state persistence and cross-platform support.
    - [Stairs](https://github.com/jakehildreth/Stairs): A tiny tool for *identifying* AD CS issue combinations that may not be readily obvious that could result in forest compromise
  - developing:
    - [Locksmith 2](https://github.com/jakehildreth/Locksmith2): An AD CS toolkit for AD Admins, Defensive Security Professionals, and Filthy Red Teamers.
    - [PSCertutil](https://github.com/jakehildreth/PSCertutil): A PowerShell wrapper for certutil.exe.

  - A Microsoft MVP?
- 🌱 I’m always learning AD/AD CS security but mostly learning how to develop PowerShell.
